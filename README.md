# Milo the Ginger Bear
A massively over-engineered website about a small sausage dog, Milo.

## Practical
All info you could possibly need about dog-sitting Milo, in one place.

## Practicing
I use Milo's website to practice using certain tech tools, languages, etc.

__Development & Running__

milo.dog is set up for local development using Docker (via a mounted volume).

From project root: `yarn start`

Then visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

As you make changes to the code, they'll be reflected.

__Testing__

`yarn test`
