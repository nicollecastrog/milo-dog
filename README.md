# Milo the Ginger Bear
A massively over-engineered website about a small sausage dog, Milo.

## Practical
All info you could possibly need about dog-sitting Milo, in one place.

## Practicing
I use Milo's website to practice using certain tech tools, languages, etc.

__Development & Running__

_milo.dog_ is set up for local development using Docker (via a mounted volume). Ensure you have Docker and yarn installed on your machine before proceeding.

From project root: `yarn start`

Then visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

As you make changes to the code, they'll be reflected.

__Running in production mode__

`yarn serve`

__Testing__
